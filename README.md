# GameplayAbilitySystem
This is the code for the multiplayer gameplay ability system.
In the project i added the Project borealis movement and the advanced session plugin.

I unfortunately can't add the whole project because i depend on some UE4 marketplace content which i can't publish here for free.

# Build
A build of the project will be added later
